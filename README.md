# DevReactions for Ruby/Sinatra

Love the animated GIFs from [DevOpsReaction](http://devopsreactions.tumblr.com) and [InfosecReactions](http://securityreactions.tumblr.com)? 

This little Ruby/Sinatra app fetches those feeds and displays the GIFs in a random order in fullscreen without any clutter.

[Example (on Heroku)](http://devreactions-ruby.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation

```bash
bundle install
rake
rackup
```

Fire up your browser and go to: [http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292). If you're using Google Chrome, hit cmd+Shift+F for full-screen mode. 
If you're on OS X, you might like [Websaver](https://code.google.com/p/websaver/), which let's you display a website (e.g. this app) as a screen-saver.

Enjoy! :)
